  <note displayLabel="Provenance">Oxford antiquary Philip Bliss (1787-1857) was one of the first collectors to recognize the historical and cultural importance of medieval manuscript fragments. These books survived intact in England until ca. 1520-70 at which time, particularly in Oxford and Cambridge, they were taken to pieces for use by binders as pastedowns, wrappers, fly leaves, and reinforcing strips.</note>
  <note displayLabel="Acquisition">Fragments in this collection were purchased by Stanford in 1984 and 1985.</note>
